Title: Detection of Interrupted Causal Structures in Mediation Models of Composites
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Ethan M. McCormick
Maintainer: Ethan M. McCormick <ethan.mccormick@radboudumc.nl>
Description: This package probes the individual-item structure of composites  
    (e.g., sums, means, products) in mediation models to detect interrupted 
    mediation, where some items support the A path but others the B path, or
    suppressed mediation where only a small subset of items mediate the effect.
